  Normally, Jenkins will discover the Active Directory domain controllers via DNS, and connect them in the
  order of priority specified in DNS. You can override this behavior by explicitly specifying the host name
  of the domain controller (and optionally the LDAP port, by appending ":NNN".)

  <p>
  This is useful when the advertised list of domain controller priority is messed up.
